# CSS Box Models

Understanding width and height <br>

# Border

border-width, border-color and border-style, box-sizing property  <br>
border-left-color, border-right-color such as can be set <br>
can use border shorthand property which inclue width , style and color <br>

Box Model Practice Exercise<br>

# Padding

Padding Shorthand Property is interesting <br>
padding: 10px (It apply to all four sides) <br>
padding: 5px 10px ( vertical | horizontal ) <br>
padding: 1px 2px 2px (top | horizontal | bottom) <br>
<br>
padding: 5px 1px 0 2px; (top | right | bottom |left) <br>
I recommend we can refer to clockwise movement like it went from top to the right and then bottom to the left <br>
<hr>

# Margin

The sames goes to the Margin Shorthand Property as the same of padding. <br>
But margin works outside of the border when padding works between content and border <br>
Margin is the space between the outside of an element and other elements <br>
<hr>

# Display Property

there's a lot of display property such as inline,block,inline-block <br>
<h3>Inline</h3> - Width & Height are ignored. Margin & padding push elements away horizontally but not vertically. <br>
<h3>Block</h3> - Block elements break the flow of a document. Width, Height, & Padding are respected. <br>
<h3>Inline-Block</h3> - Behaved like an inline element except Width, Height, Margin, & Padding are respected.

# CSS Units

% Percentages are always relative to some other value<br>
width: 50% - half the width of the parent <br>
line-height: 50% - half the font-size of the element itself <br><br>
em's are relative units , 1em equals the font-size of the parent element <br>
root ems relative to the root html element's font-size.
